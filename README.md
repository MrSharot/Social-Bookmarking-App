# Social-Bookmarking-App
- A very basic backend work of social bookmarking app(with kid friendly feature) using Java language
- No database is added
- I've implemented MVC architecture in this project.
- There's also Junit testing file to check the internal programm accuracy.
- This project basically includes all the basic implementation of Java concepts (like: polymorphisom, inheritence, abstraction.. and many more)
- As i haven't worked with database here, all the data is fetched from the text file in this application!
